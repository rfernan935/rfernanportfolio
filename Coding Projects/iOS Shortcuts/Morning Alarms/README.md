To streamline my morning routine, I created a pair of iOS Shortcuts designed to efficiently toggle multiple alarms on or off with a single tap—or automatically at bedtime. This solves the hassle of manually managing several closely timed alarms, which I rely on to wake up effectively.

“Work Alarms On Steps.gif” illustrates the first shortcut in the pair, which enables morning alarms. Upon activation, the shortcut prompts the user with the question: Do you have work tomorrow? From there, the user can select one of four options:

Yes, at 6am: Activates a predefined group of alarms optimized for a 6am wake-up.

Yes, at 7am: Activates a predefined group of alarms optimized for a 7am wake-up.

Yes, a different time: Opens the Clock app for manual alarm setup.

No: Ends the shortcut without activating any alarms.

“Disable Alarms Steps.gif” showcases the companion shortcut, which toggles off all alarms that may have been activated by the first shortcut.

“Morning Alarms Shortcut Demo.gif” demonstrates both shortcuts in action, providing a complete overview of the user experience.
