I developed a collection of seven iOS Shortcuts that together function as an interactive hub for a drinking-style party game. One shortcut serves as the main hub, while the remaining six act as modular game functions and supporting utilities.

[RebeccaPlayAGameSteps.gif](https://github.com/rfernan935/rfernanportfolio/blob/main/Coding%20Projects/iOS%20Shortcuts/Play-a-Game%20Hub/RebeccaPlayAGameSteps.gif) demonstrates the central hub shortcut. It welcomes the user and presents a prompt — Play a Game? — with three options:

Check game rules: Launches the “Game Rules” shortcut

Yes: Launches the “Play a Game” shortcut

No: Thanks the user and ends the session

[GameRulesSteps.gif](https://github.com/rfernan935/rfernanportfolio/blob/main/Coding%20Projects/iOS%20Shortcuts/Play-a-Game%20Hub/GameRulesSteps.gif) showcases the “Game Rules” shortcut, which lets users browse and select from a list of games to view their rules. After viewing, users can either return to the main menu or continue exploring other game rules.

[PlayAGameSteps.gif](https://github.com/rfernan935/rfernanportfolio/blob/main/Coding%20Projects/iOS%20Shortcuts/Play-a-Game%20Hub/PlayAGameSteps.gif) walks through the gameplay shortcut. Users choose from a list of available games; the chosen game’s shortcut is then run. After completing a round, users are asked if they'd like to play another game or end the session.

Each one prompts players for category preferences and/or number of rounds, then delivers randomized prompts accordingly, repeating based on the selected round count.

[RebeccaPlayAGameHubDemo.gif(https://github.com/rfernan935/rfernanportfolio/blob/main/Coding%20Projects/iOS%20Shortcuts/Play-a-Game%20Hub/RebeccaPlayAGameHubDemo.gif) captures a full session: the user opens the main hub, views rules for “Cheers to the Governor” and plays one round, then views the rules for “Would You Rather" and plays three rounds of it before exiting.
