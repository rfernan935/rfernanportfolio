### Overview of the Stock Market Simulator
This C++ program is a stock market simulator that allows users to:

- Buy and sell shares.
- Add cash to their account.
- View current holdings (including individual stock values and total net worth).
- Track stock price changes (with highest and lowest values recorded).
- Generate a final report summarizing the user's financial position.

## Key Features and How They Work
1. Initialization
The program begins by welcoming the user and asking for an initial cash investment (minimum $100).
It initializes 10 popular stock names (e.g., Apple, Microsoft) and assigns random starting prices between $50 and $150.
Each stock's highest and lowest price trackers are initialized to the starting price.
3. Main Menu Options
The main menu presents five options:

1. Buy Shares
2. Sell Shares
3. Add Cash to the Account
4. Print Current Holdings
5. Quit the Program

3. Buying Shares
The user is prompted to select a stock from the list.
They enter the number of shares they want to purchase. The program ensures the user has enough cash for the purchase.
