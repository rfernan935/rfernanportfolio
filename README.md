# Rebecca Fernandez - Tech Portfolio
AI- and ethics-driven technologist with a background in psychology, philosophy, and computer science. I’m passionate about building intuitive, human-centered tools - especially at the intersection of software, cognition, and real-world interactivity. Currently focused on language models, embedded systems, and the future of ethical AI.

## Featured Projects
### Local Large Language Model (LLM) Projects
LLM Projects including the integration of local LLMs with persistent memory systems, using models like Gemma and Llama 2 through Ollama. Focused on building adaptive, context-aware AI interactions with a C++-based chat history framework.
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/rfernan935/rfernanportfolio/tree/main/Coding%20Projects/LLM%20Projects)

#### Local LLM Exploration: Gemma, Llama 2, and Persistent Memory Prototyping
This project explores the integration of local LLMs like Gemma and Llama 2 with a focus on persistent memory systems, using C++ and Ollama. It lays the groundwork for adaptive, context-aware AI applications by prototyping a persistent chat history and dynamic learning framework. Future development aims to evolve this system into a lightweight, interactive AI tutor that personalizes itself over time.
